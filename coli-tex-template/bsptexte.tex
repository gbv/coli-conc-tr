%  Kurze Einleitung zu den Unterkapiteln

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.\footnote{\citet{Wartena2015}}

Jemand musste Josef K. verleumdet haben, denn ohne dass er etwas Böses getan hätte, wurde er eines Morgens verhaftet. "Wie ein Hund!" sagte er, es war, als sollte die Scham ihn überleben. Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer verwandelt. Und es war ihnen wie eine Bestätigung ihrer neuen Träume und guten Absichten, als am Ziele ihrer Fahrt die Tochter als erste sich erhob und ihren jungen Körper dehnte. "Es ist ein eigentümlicher Apparat", sagte der Offizier zu dem Forschungsreisenden und überblickte mit einem gewissermaßen bewundernden Blick den ihm doch wohlbekannten Apparat. Sie hätten noch ins Boot springen können, aber der Reisende hob ein schweres, geknotetes Tau vom Boden, drohte ihnen damit und hielt sie dadurch von dem Sprunge ab. In den letzten Jahrzehnten ist das Interesse an Hungerkünstlern sehr zurückgegangen. Aber sie überwanden sich, umdrängten den Käfig und wollten sich gar nicht fortrühren.\footnote{\citet{Bottou2014}}

For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.

Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns.

When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now.

He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

Luke! Luke! Luke! Hey! Hey! I knew you'd come back! I just knew it! Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward. Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Oh, no! Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you? We'll get to work on him right away. You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them. He'll be all right.

Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!
