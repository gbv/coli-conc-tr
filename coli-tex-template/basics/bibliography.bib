abstract="Regional Innovation Systems describe the relations between actors, structures and infrastructures in a region in order to stimulate innovation and regional development. For these systems the collection and organization of information is crucial. In the present paper we investigate the possibilities to extract information from websites of companies. Especially we consider faceted classification of companies by keyword extraction using a specialized thesaurus. First we identify a number of challenges that arise when we want to extract information about companies from their websites. Then we describe a small scale experiment in which keywords related to economic sectors and commodities are extracted from the websites of over 200 companies. The experiment shows that the approach is at least feasible for the commodities facet. For the sectors facet the simple keyword extraction methods used do not perform well. We find that a good coverage of words in the text by the thesaurus is crucial and that hence the results can be improved by adding more alternative labels to the thesaurus terms. Furthermore, we find that weighting terms according to their relations to other terms on the website instead of using inverse document frequency gives better results than the classical tf.idf weighting of terms.",

abstract="AÂ plausible definition of ``reasoning'' could be ``algebraically manipulating previously acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question''. This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labelled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text.",
