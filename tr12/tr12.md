This report explores methods to identify individual mappings between concepts from knowledge organization systems. 

## Background

Knowledge graphs or knowledge organization systems represent concepts such as
people, places, topics, and events. Concordances help to align multiple
knowledge graphs by definition of mappings between concepts from different
systems. Management of concordances requires the description of individual
mappings with metadata. For this reason the JSKOS data model extends SKOS by
treatment of [mappings](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/#concept-mappings) as
first-class entities. For instance the RDF triple

~~~turtle
<http://dewey.info/class/612.112/> skos:closeMatch <http://d-nb.info/gnd/4074195-3> .
~~~

can be expressed in JSKOS as

~~~json
{
    "type": [ "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#closeMatch" ],
    "from": {
        "memberSet": [ { "uri": "http://dewey.info/class/612.112/" } ]
    },
    "to": {
        "memberSet": [ { "uri": "http://d-nb.info/gnd/4074195-3" } ]
    }
}
~~~

The optional description of mappings with metadata includes support of URIs and
other kind of identifiers. Such mapping identifiers are required to reference
mappings for publication, annotation, and update, among other use cases.

## Reuse of existing mapping identifiers

If mappings are stored in a retrievable database with public identifiers, these
identifiers should always be reused. Unfortunately most mappings don't have
individual identifiers -- a large part of project coli-conc is to find,
collect, and express existing mappings in machine-readable form. A rare example
of existing mapping identifiers are given by statement identifiers in Wikidata.
For instance the mapping between Wikidata item `Q60025` and GND record
`11850391X` is given in RDF as:
    
    @prefix wd:  <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
    @prefix wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/> .
    @prefix psn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/> .

    wd:Q60025 p:P227 wds:q60025-D1F72F80-346B-4150-8E4B-4888307A6C4D .
    wds:q60025-D1F72F80-346B-4150-8E4B-4888307A6C4D psn:P227 <http://d-nb.info/gnd/11850391X> .

This translates to JSKOS as:

~~~json
{
    "uri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/q60025-D1F72F80-346B-4150-8E4B-4888307A6C4D",
    "type": [ "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#exactMatch" ],
    "from": {
        "memberSet": [ { "uri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60025" } ]
    },
    "to": {
        "memberSet": [ { "uri": "http://d-nb.info/gnd/11850391X" } ]
    }
}
~~~

A wrapper to access such mappings from Wikidata items to external identifiers
has been implemented and made available as part of project coli-conc.^[See
<https://github.com/gbv/wikidata-jskos>.]

## General properties of new mapping identifiers

For newly created mappings we can defined and manage identifiers in the
database. Virtually any existing identifier system can be used as long as it is
embedded in the URI/IRI system. In practise three forms are relevant:

1. HTTP-URIs with random local identifier such as
   `http://example.org/mappings/88504be0-67f5-4a1f-87e1-d957f699d24f`.
   This is applied with statement identifiers in Wikidata.

2. HTTP-URIs with consecutively numbered local identifier such as
   `http://example.org/mappings/12345`. This will be applied for newly
   created mappings in the main mapping database of project coli-conc.

3. Non-HTTP URIs such as `urn:uuid:88504be0-67f5-4a1f-87e1-d957f699d24f`.
   This is useful if mappings should not be bound to a specific database.

## Content-based mapping identifiers

To decouple mapping identifiers from their sources, identifiers can be derived
automatically from mappings. Such identifiers can be implemented with a hash
function and normalization rules that ensure same mappings result in same
identifiers and different mappings result in different identifiers. Multiple
sameness criteria can be defined:

1. Same **mapping members** (same set of member concepts)

2. Same **mapping content** (same mapping members with same bundle types,
   mapping types, and mapping direction)

3. Same **mapping metadata** (fully identical mappings). This option is not
   practical because any minor change in metadata results in a different
   identifier.

The final form of an identifier further depends on the specific hash method and
how the hash value is embedded in the URI/IRI system. No official URI namespace
for cryptographic hashes exist so far, but an URN namespace draft
[@thiemann2003] has received some adoption, so project coli-conc will use
lowercase SHA1 hash sums with prefix `urn:sha1:`.

### Mapping member identifier

Compact JSON array with concept URIs sorted by Unicode code point, followed by
newline character (U+000A).

Example:

```json
["http://d-nb.info/gnd/11850391X","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60025"]
```

Mapping member identifier: `urn:sha1:a97ee5e5f536b4fb316e2951da92b437dbd707c7`

### Mapping content identifier

Compact, JSKOS mapping object, followed by newline character (U+000A) with
exactely these sorted keys:

* `from` with `memberSet`, `memberChoice` or `memberList`
* `to` with `memberSet`, `memberChoice` or `memberList`
* `type` with an array of one element

Where elements of `memberSet`/`memberChoice`/`memberList` arrays each have
only a `uri` key.

Example (Wikidata mapping above): `urn:sha1:a46239c33798b78d1c0a35a615e4535a4c8a2634`.

`urn:jskos:mapping:members:`

## Notes

Mapping recommendations created on the fly don't need an identifier.

If two sources import this mapping with different metadata, both will be merged??

Mappings imported from other sources, updates. Take care not to import the same mapping multiple times.

Where to put these identifiers? field `identifier` or `uri`.

## Usae cases / summary

How can mappings be identified? This depends on the use case.

* Detect "similar" mappings: mapping member hash
* Detect "same" mappings (independent from origin and relevance): mapping content hash


...

Content-based sameness criteria will be added to the JSKOS specification.
