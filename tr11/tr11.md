This report gives an update on the architecture of Cocoda, a mapping tool for
concordances between library knowledge organization systems that is being
developed at the head office of GBV Common Library Network (VZG). A new
implementation or Cocoda has been started from scratch.

## Background

The aim of project coli-conc is an infrastructure to facilitate management and
exchange of concordances between library knowledge organization systems. In
particular this includes a web application to manage, create, and evaluate
mappings. Since its beginning in 2015, the technical and organizational
background of the project and its mapping tool have evolved. After some
attempts with a monolithical Java application we revisited our original plan of
a modularized web application. Based on experiences with two prototypes and the
mapping data collected so far we started with a new implementation in May 2018.
This report supersedes the Cocoda primer [@tr1] with an overview of the current
technical architecture.

## JSKOS Data Format

The core of the concordances infrastructure turned out to be the [JSKOS data
format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/) for knowledge organization systems. In
short this format is an application profile of JSON-LD [@JSONLD] for SKOS
[@SKOS] extended by support of mappings, concordances, usage statistics, and
optional closed world statements [@JSKOS]. The specification has reached a
stable state with only minor additions to be discussed.

## Cocoda Web Application

The new version of Cocoda is build as singe page web application using the [Vue
JavaScript framework](https://vuejs.org/) instead of AngularJS. We had some
good experiences with the latter [@code4lib] but Vue turned out to be more
manageable. The application can be broken down into four main components:

---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**concept browser**    based on a hierarchical navigation and a detailled display of selected concepts
**mapping editor**     to create, modify, and annotate mappings
**mapping browser**    to show existing mappings and mapping recommendations from multiple sources
**occurrences table**  to show the number of times selected concepts are used in library catalogs
---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These components shall also be usable independently from Cocoda for instance to
provide hierarchical browsing in one classification. Additional parts of the
application for interaction with backend services may be pubished as [npm
modules](https://www.npmjs.com) which can also be used for server side
applications.

The web application is developed publically at <https://github.com/gbv/cocoda>
with technical documentation published at <https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/>. We
use a Kanban board at [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io) for project management and
[travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration.

## Backend Web Services

The web application communicates with independent backend services, mainly in
JSKOS format:

* **terminology services** such <https://api.dante.gbv.de/>, Skosmos etc. [@poster]
* **mapping providers** with concordances and mapping recommendations
* **occurrence services** that look up (combined) usage of concepts in library catalogs
* **mapping stores** allow creation, modification, and annotation of mappings
* **identiy providers** manage user accounts and provide access tokens via OAuth2

## Additional Data Processing

Backend services and additional data processing pipelines are implemented with
different technologies. In particular we use and contribute to:

* **[mc2skos](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mc2skos)** command line application for
  converting MARC 21 records to JSKOS

* **[Catmandu](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Catmandu/lib/Catmandu/Introduction.pod)**
  data processing toolkit for access to and transformation of other library data

* **[wikidata-taxonomy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/wikidata-taxonomy)**
  and **[wdmapper](https://wdmapper.readthedocs.io/)** Wikidata
  authority file extraction and mapping tools
